# Security Model-White-box Model
A **White-box Model**, in contrast to a [[Security Model-Black-box Model|Black-box model]] or [[Security Model-Grey-box Model|Grey-box model]], allows an attacker to possess all details of a system. A White-box attacker may access any component of the system, including unit testing, integration testing, and fuzzing (regression testing) for analysis.

# Topic-Side-Channel Attacks
A **side-channel** attack is any attack based on the implementation details of an algorithm, rather than the design of the algorithm. Side-channel attacks typically operate in a [[Term-Grey-box Model|grey-box]] or [[Term-White-box Model|white-box]] model, where the attacker has access to system internals. Side-channel attacks typically do not include [[Term-Social Engineering|social engineering]] or interrogation techniques.

# Security Model-Ciphertext-Only Attack (COA)
The **Ciphertext Only Attack Model** is a weak adversary model, in which the adversary can only listen to encrypted communications and aims to decrypt further encrypted communications. The CCA model is weaker than the [[Security Model-Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)|KPA]], or [[Security Model-Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA)|CPA]], and [[Security Model-Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)|CCA]] adversary models, and is not commonly used for modern encryption analysis.

# Security Model-Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA)
The **Chosen Plaintext Attack Model** is a [[Security Model-Black-box Model|black box model]] in which the adversary is given access to an [[Term-Oracle|oracle]] to encrypt any plaintext of the adversary's choosing, and attempts to derive the key. The CPA model is stronger than the [[Security Model-Ciphertext-Only Attack (COA)|COA]] and [[Security Model-Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)|KPA]] models, but weaker than the [[Security Model-Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)]] model.

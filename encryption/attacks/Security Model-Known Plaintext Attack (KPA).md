# Security Model-Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)
The **Known Plaintext Attack Model** is a weak adversary model, in which the adversary is given a set of ciphertext-plaintext pairs, and aims to decrypt further encrypted communications. The KPA model is stronger than the [[Security Model-Ciphertext-Only Attack (COA)|COA]] model, but weaker than the [[Security Model-Chosen-Plaintext Attack (CPA)|CPA]], and [[Security Model-Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)|CCA]] adversary models, and is not commonly used for modern encryption analysis.

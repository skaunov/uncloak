# Security Model-Distinguishing Attack
A **distinguishing attack** is any nontrivial method for determining a difference between encrypted ciphertext data and random noise. That is, a distinguishing attack is any method for differentiating an [[Abstraction-Ideal Encryption Scheme|ideal encryption scheme]] from a real encryption scheme. The theoretical existence of a distinguishing attack is not sufficient to entirely disqualify the soundness of an encryption scheme, but modern encryption schemes are expected to be effectively immune to distinguishing attacks.

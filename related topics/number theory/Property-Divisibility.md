# Property-Divisibility
For two [[Set-Integers|integers]], $a$ and $b$, we say $b$ *divides* $a$ (written: $b\mid a$) if there exists some integer $c\ne1$ such that:
$$a-bc=0$$

If $b$ does not divide $a$, we write $b\nmid a$. 

If there exists some positive integer $d$ such that $d\mid a$ and $d\mid b$, then we call $d$ a **common divisor**; if it is the largest such value, it is the [[Property-Greatest Common Divisor|greatest common divisor]].
